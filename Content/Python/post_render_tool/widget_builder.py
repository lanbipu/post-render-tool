"""Widget Builder — VP Post-Render Tool.

Loads ``BP_PostRenderToolWidget`` from the plugin's virtual content root,
spawns it as an editor tab via ``EditorUtilitySubsystem``, and hands the
live instance to ``widget.PostRenderToolUI``, which binds
Python callbacks to the widgets exposed by the BindWidget contract in
``UPostRenderToolWidget`` (C++).

**Blueprint distribution: automation-first, manual as fallback** (reverses
the bd140d7 "manual-only" stance, 2026-04-17). ``docs/widget-tree-spec.json``
is the single source of truth; ``rebuild_from_spec()`` (this module) →
``build_widget_blueprint.run_build()`` → ``UPostRenderToolBuildHelper`` C++
UFUNCTION bridge populates ``UWidgetBlueprint::WidgetTree`` idempotently
(existing user tweaks survive; ``force_reapply=True`` overrides for
theme-level edits). UE 5.7 still doesn't expose ``WidgetTree`` directly to
Python reflection — the helper UFUNCTIONs are the official escape hatch.

This module *consumes* the committed asset for normal runtime use; when
that asset is missing, prefer:

  1. ``git pull`` / ``p4 sync`` to recover the committed copy, OR
  2. ``rebuild_from_spec()`` to regenerate from JSON spec, OR
  3. ``docs/bootstrap-checklist.md`` for the manual fallback path
     (only when both spec and depot are unavailable — fresh projects
     before automation existed, or upstream wipe + spec corruption).

The Blueprint's widget tree must satisfy the BindWidget contract in
``Source/PostRenderTool/Public/PostRenderToolWidget.h``; missing required
widgets fail the Blueprint compile. See ``TEMPLATE_SETUP_INSTRUCTIONS``
below for sync/restore commands when the asset is missing or corrupt.

Blueprint asset not found: {WIDGET_ASSET_PATH}

BP_PostRenderToolWidget is normally distributed via source control; the
preferred regeneration path is `rebuild_from_spec()` (JSON spec → BP).
Pick the recovery path that matches your situation:

Scenario A — fresh clone, you never had the asset locally
---------------------------------------------------------
You just cloned the repo / synced the workspace for the first time, and
the .uasset has never existed in your working directory.

  • git repo:  git pull   (brings down the committed .uasset as part of the
               initial checkout)
  • p4 depot:  p4 sync    (same, pulls the head revision)

Verify {WIDGET_ASSET_PATH} now exists on disk, restart the Editor, retry.

Scenario B — you had it before, but the local file is gone / corrupt
--------------------------------------------------------------------
The asset existed locally at some point but you deleted it, a merge blew
it away, or it got corrupt. The depot copy is still healthy. `git pull`
and plain `p4 sync` WILL NOT help here — git pull only fetches new commits
(it doesn't restore working-tree deletions), and p4 sync short-circuits
with "up-to-date" when the head revision is already recorded as synced.
Use the correct per-SCM recovery command:

  • git repo:  git restore Content/Blueprints/BP_PostRenderToolWidget.uasset
               (or: git checkout HEAD -- <path>)
  • p4 depot:  p4 sync -f //depot/.../BP_PostRenderToolWidget.uasset
               (the -f flag force-resyncs even if p4 thinks you're current;
               alternatively `p4 revert` if the file is open in a changelist)

Scenario C — fresh project, no .uasset committed yet, but spec is ready
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
The spec docs/widget-tree-spec.json exists, but this project has never
committed a built BP. Use the automation path:

  from post_render_tool.widget_builder import rebuild_from_spec
  rebuild_from_spec()

This calls build_widget_blueprint.run_build() which uses
unreal.PostRenderToolBuildHelper (C++ UFUNCTION bridge) to populate the
WidgetTree from the spec. Idempotent — safe to re-run. Commit the
resulting .uasset so future teammates land in Scenario A.

Scenario D — spec is also missing or corrupt (rare)
---------------------------------------------------
Manual fallback only. Follow docs/bootstrap-checklist.md to hand-author
the BP in UMG Designer per the Figma layout, then commit it. Treat this
as a one-time recovery, not a normal workflow — fix the spec afterward
so future regenerations stay automated.
